# SSTA-graphing
Python app that will graph SSTA for meteorologists and oceanographers

This python script is for graphing SSTA (Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly) and the file format must be a NetCDF type. NetCDF stands for Network Common Data Form and its how data is stored in the file.
Data is accessed using arrays and in Python with aid of Numpy and matplotlib I created an application that can graph SSTA on a 2D map.
